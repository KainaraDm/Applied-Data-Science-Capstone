Applied-Data-Science-Capstone

This is an IBM Data Science final project. 

The official cost of launching a Falcon 9 rocket is $62 million. However, if the first stage is lost, the cost of the launch could be $162 million. So if you can predict the probability of the first stage of a missile being lost, you can calculate the full cost of a launch.

The goal of the project is develop an effective model for predicting successful/unsuccessful missile launch as a function of launch conditions. 

The structure and main results of the final project are in presentation (Project_results.pdf).
