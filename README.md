Applied-Data-Science-Capstone

This is an IBM Data Science final project. 

The official cost of launching a Falcon 9 rocket is $62 million. However, if the first stage is lost, the cost of the launch could be $162 million. So if you can predict the probability of the first stage of a missile being lost, you can calculate the full cost of a launch.

The goal of the project is develop an effective model for predicting successful/unsuccessful missile launch as a function of launch conditions. 

The structure of the final project are:

1. Data collecting: jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb and jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api (1).ipynb
2. Data analisis: labs-jupyter-spacex-Data wrangling.ipynb
3. Creating and working with database by SQL: jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera.ipynb
4. Visualization the launch sites with Folium: lab_jupyter_launch_site_location (1).ipynb
5. Data visualization: jupyter-labs-eda-dataviz.ipynb
6. Data dashboard: spacex_dash_app.py
7. Machine learning models: SpaceX_Machine Learning Prediction.ipynb

The main results of the final project are in presentation (Project_results.pdf).
